An extremely small and simple plugin which allows one to easily embed videos (FLV, F4V and MP4 files) into WordPress blogs.

== Description ==

The KVS FLV Player plugin (developed by [CyberSEO.net](http://www.cyberseo.net/ "CyberSEO.net")) allows one to easily embed videos (FLV, F4V and MP4 files) into WordPress blogs using the universal FLV tag style:

        [flv:url image width height link player]

where:

* url - URL of the video file you want to embed;
* image - URL of a preview image (shown in display and playlist). The preview image must be stored on local host as it's required by KVS Player;
* width - width of an video (default: 450);
* height - height of an video (default: 317);
* link - URL to an external page the display, controlbar and playlist can link to (default: #);
* player - URL to FLV player (default: /wp-content/plugins/kvs-flv-player/kt_player.swf).

The plugin uses the freeware KVS Player 2.4 by [Kernel Team](http://www.kernel-video-sharing.com/en/player/ "Kernel Team").
